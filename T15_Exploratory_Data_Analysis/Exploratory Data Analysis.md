# README for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Titanic Dataset

## Table of Contents:

### Description
This Jupyter Notebook (titanic.ipynb) conducts an in-depth exploratory data analysis on the Titanic dataset. The analysis explores various aspects of the dataset, including passenger demographics, survival rates, and factors influencing survival. Visualizations such as histograms, bar plots, and scatter plots are used to gain insights into the dataset.

Learning EDA is essential for anyone involved in data analysis, machine learning, or data-driven decision-making processes. It forms the basis for more advanced statistical and machine learning techniques and ensures robust understanding and interpretation of data.
